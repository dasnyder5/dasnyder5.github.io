_[Steve Blank](https://msande.stanford.edu/people/steven-blank), [Steve Weinstein](https://h4cs.stanford.edu/people/steve-weinstein), [Pete Newell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petenewell), [Joe Felter](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/joseph_felter), [Tom Bedecarr√©](https://msande.stanford.edu/people/thomas-bedecarre), [Jeff Decker](https://energy.stanford.edu/people/jeff-decker)_  
Solving National Security issues with the Lean Launchpad. Student teams apply lean startup principles to national security problems to discover and validate customer needs, building iterative prototypes to test product-mission fit. Teams take a hands-on approach requiring close engagement with military, DoD, and other government agency end-users.  
**ME 70 -- Introductory Fluids Engineering: Winter 2020**  
_[Professor Mark Capelli](https://profiles.stanford.edu/mark-cappelli)_
